# WWDC19 Submission
This application is my WWDC19 Submission.
## Game Basics
As anyone writes any form of code, they normally run into several errors and warnings a long the way. This application is a 2D infinitly scrolling platformer in which you avoid "writing errors" as you write lines of code. In order to jump, you simply tap anywhere on the screen.

## FAQ
**What was used to write this application?**
I used SpriteKit to write this application in playground.
**How long did this application take to write?**
I wrote this application across 4 total days, most of which was spent learning about SpriteKit via documentation and online tutorials.
**Where are the assets from?**
All assets except the macOS error sound and symbol are created by me, although I editted the modern-day warning and error symbols.
**Did you make it in to WWDC19?**
As of writing this, I don't know if I made it into WWDC19 yet. However, due to the high amount of talented people applying, I doubt this submission will be accepted. It was fun to program nonetheless.
